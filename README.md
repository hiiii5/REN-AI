Realism Extension Netowork - AI Overhaul

My intentions are to improve all aspects of the game and today I am going to talk about my goals with AI and their interaction with the world as well as altercations with the player.

The main goals of this modification are:
* AI should have interaction with the world space and feel like a living being instead of electrons on a chipset.
* AI should work as a group and not simply "be a group", when under fire they usually blob and stay where they are.
* AI not in immediate combat but there is a known enemy in their vicinity should asses the situation and then move to aid those under fire.
* Those with launchers/GL/Smokes should use them as aid, if they are being overwhelmed then they will filter a target by priority and use their launchers/GL's to engage targets with a calculated effectiveness not based on random chance.
  Those with smoke should use them to break contact and those with flares should use them to alert others during night.
* If there are air contacts and a given unit is not in immediate contact they should attempt to fire at the air given that they are within range and should use launchers with the same paramaters as before, where priority comes into play.
* AI should have contact with a commander or other immediate squads but not the whole world and communication and response time should be adjusted accordingly, if all contacts are dead then QRF should be dismissed and returned their original positions and tasks.
* Suppressors should provide a true stealth experience where AI that are not given the chance to alert others will not throw the group into a tantrum unless the kill is seen by others or those firing do so ineffectively.
* AI should not be able to have a "sixth sense" and only be able to be notified by themselves if they can see something within their viewing angle.

You may follow this on github and fork it if you like to code, you may contribute based on push requests, and it is free to use as is and modify.
If you contribute please ensure all code is well written, not optimized as that will be the final pass as "premature optimization is the root of all evil".
I hope to have this completed within a month and then get on to the weapons portion of REN.
